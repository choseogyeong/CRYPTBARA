You are a security analyst. Evaluate the cryptographic API usage in the following code based on the rule and inter-procedural dependency.
Important constraints:
- Do not assume that the code must contain a misuse. It may or may not.
- Only consider misuses within the given rule. Do not invent new types of misuses outside the rule.

<rule>
{RULE}
</rule>

<code>
{CODE}
</code>

<dependency>
{MERGED_DEPENDENCY_JSON}
</dependency>

<call_chain>
{CALL_CHAIN}
</call_chain>

If applicable, specify which rule(s) (by ID and category) were violated.  
Respond strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "misuses": [
    {{
      "id": <rule_id>,
      "category": "<rule_category>",
      "location": "<code location>",
      "description": "<detailed description>",
      "severity": "<High/Medium/Low>"
    }}
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "<recommendation 1>",
    "<recommendation 2>"
  ],
  "analysis_summary": "<summary>"
}}
